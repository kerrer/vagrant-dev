## Status:
This project was always meant to be a useful tool for its author. Others found
it helpful, and I was happy to share and help improve it. From my perspective,
it's now mostly feature complete, and since I've been focusing most of my time
on [mgmt](https://github.com/purpleidea/mgmt/), there aren't any major planned
changes coming. As a result please use, share and enjoy it, but development is
going to be limited to what the community provides. We have other maintainers,
so that I'm not a bottleneck on any patch reviews or merges! Happy hacking! --

## Module specific notes:

* This was born as 'vagrant-puppet-docker-template'...
* I decided it could be more useful as a general project...
* I renamed it because the original name was dumb...
* The current name is obviously a nod to the success of the 'oh-my-zsh' project, although I'm actually a bash user :)
* It is an attempt to provide a general purpose environment to make it easier to get hacking on vagrant+puppet+docker things.
* There are still some unresolved issues, but it can be useful as reference, or as a starting point for a hacker to customize.
* There are a number of published articles about this environment:
