TODO

* Add nested virt test to see if host has it enabled
** dustymabe+stribny will patch this
*** http://dustymabe.com/2013/07/14/find-guest-ip-address-using-qemu-guest-agent/
* Add automatic qemu agent + virtualbox agent installation
** lala(virtualbox) + dustymabe(vagrant-libvirt) will work on this patch
* Have a way to pass structured or non-string facts into the vms.
** Puppet could support a B64FACTER_name=... where the data is a base64 yaml.
*** This would be useful anyways, but isn't the ideal approach for vagrant.
** One way could be to write to /etc/facter/facts.d/ before each puppet run.
*** https://github.com/mitchellh/vagrant/issues/4762
* Provide a way to add parameters to the classes we include.
* Add some documentation.
