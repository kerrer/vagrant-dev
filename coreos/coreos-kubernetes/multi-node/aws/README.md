# kube-aws has moved!

If you're looking for kube-aws, it has been moved to a new [dedicated repository](https://github.com/coreos/kube-aws). All oustanding AWS-related issues and PRs should be moved to there. This repository will continue to host development on single and multi node vagrant distributions.

This folder has now been deprecated, and may at some point in the future be deleted. Future releases from this repository will not contain kube-aws binaries. It is recommended that you migrate all dependencies on this repository  to `github.com/coreos/kube-aws` at your earliest convenience.

The old README can be accessed [here](./README_DEPRECATED.md).
